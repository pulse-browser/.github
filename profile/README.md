We are a small (read two people) team trying to make building and maintaining
custom web browsers far simpler.

## Our goals

Firefox forks are far less prevalent than Chromium browsers. Sure, there are a
few, like Dot Browser, Waterfox and Pale Moon, but they don't have a large market
share. We think the reason for this is that it is just easier to fork chromium
because more people have done it. Our goal is to create a Firefox fork, layout
best practices and create tooling that makes building browsers with Firefox easier
than ever before.

## What we work on

- [Pulse browser](https://github.com/pulse-browser/browser) - Building a better firefox
- [Gluon](https://github.com/pulse-browser/gluon) - Build firefox browsers faster
- [ff-ext-types](https://github.com/pulse-browser/ff-ext-types) - Better typescript support for Firefox WebExtensions
